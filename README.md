# 🫀 Heart Attack Risk Detection Using Retinal Images

A machine learning system designed to predict heart attack risk by analyzing retinal images. This project leverages deep learning and vascular pattern recognition to enable early, non-invasive cardiovascular risk assessment.

## 📌 Overview

- 🧠 Built using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** models
- 🏥 Trained on the **RFMiD dataset** with over 3,200 annotated retinal images
- 🔍 Focused on identifying vascular patterns linked to cardiovascular risk
- 🔬 Enables early-stage heart attack prediction using retinal scans

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- RFMiD Dataset

## 🧹 Preprocessing

- Image resizing, cropping, and normalization
- Data augmentation to improve generalization
- Vascular region enhancement using clustering techniques
